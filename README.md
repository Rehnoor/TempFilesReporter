# TempFilesReporter
This Python script will report temporary files to you. From then, you can decide to delete all the reported files. The criteria for temporary files are ones that end with: .tmp, .log, .cache, .part, .partial, and directories called tmp or .cache.

DISCLAIMER: Be VERY careful when deleting the files as they will be non-recoverable. Be very careful with System files. Avoid searching for files under your root directory as that will take a lot of time to scan and you may risk deleting critical system files.
